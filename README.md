## About This Project:
GifTastic is a site I had to make for homework, as part of the Northwestern University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, whose purpse was to demonstrate my understading of using ajax and API's.

GifTastic was built with HTML, CSS3, Bootstrap4, Javascript and JQuery 3.3.1.

## How to Use:
Click on the name of a character above, you should get a list of 10 gifs, when you click on a gif it should play until you click on it again. You can add characters to the list by entering their name then clicking submit.
